# Networking Training Project

## Description

This project is an **interactive networking training interface** designed to practice and validate fundamental networking concepts through progressive levels.

The goal of the project is to help students understand and apply core networking principles:

 * IP addressing
 * Subnet masks
 * Routing
 * OSI model
 
 by solving practical configuration challenges. Each level focuses on a specific concept or combination of concepts, reinforcing both theoretical knowledge and hands-on problem solving.

The project consists of a browser-based training interface where users configure network elements and export their solutions for evaluation.

## Instructions

### Running the Training Interface

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>


## Resources

* TCP/IP addressing
* Subnet mask
* Default gateway
* Routers
